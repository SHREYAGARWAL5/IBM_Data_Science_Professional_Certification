SpaceX Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction
Assignment: Exploring and Preparing Data
Estimated time needed: 70 minutes

In this assignment, we will predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is due to the fact that SpaceX can reuse the first stage.

In this lab, you will perform Exploratory Data Analysis and Feature Engineering.

Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully



Several examples of an unsuccessful landing are shown here:



Most unsuccessful landings are planned. Space X performs a controlled landing in the oceans.

Objectives
Perform exploratory Data Analysis and Feature Engineering using Pandas and Matplotlib

Exploratory Data Analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis
First, let's read the SpaceX dataset into a Pandas dataframe and print its summary

df=pd.read_csv("https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-DS0321EN-SkillsNetwork/datasets/dataset_part_2.csv")

# If you were unable to complete the previous lab correctly you can uncomment and load this csv

# df = pd.read_csv('https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-DS0701EN-SkillsNetwork/api/dataset_part_2.csv')

df.head(5)
FlightNumber	Date	BoosterVersion	PayloadMass	Orbit	LaunchSite	Outcome	Flights	GridFins	Reused	Legs	LandingPad	Block	ReusedCount	Serial	Longitude	Latitude	Class

First, let's try to see how the FlightNumber (indicating the continuous launch attempts.) and Payload variables would affect the launch outcome.

We can plot out the FlightNumber vs. PayloadMassand overlay the outcome of the launch. We see that as the flight number increases, the first stage is more likely to land successfully. The payload mass is also important; it seems the more massive the payload, the less likely the first stage will return.

sns.catplot(y="PayloadMass", x="FlightNumber", hue="Class", data=df, aspect = 5)
plt.xlabel("Flight Number",fontsize=20)
plt.ylabel("Pay load Mass (kg)",fontsize=20)
plt.show()

We see that different launch sites have different success rates. CCAFS LC-40, has a success rate of 60 %, while KSC LC-39A and VAFB SLC 4E has a success rate of 77%.

Next, let's drill down to each site visualize its detailed launch records.

TASK 1: Visualize the relationship between Flight Number and Launch Site
Use the function catplot to plot FlightNumber vs LaunchSite, set the parameter x parameter to FlightNumber,set the y to Launch Site and set the parameter hue to 'class'

# Plot a scatter point chart with x axis to be Flight Number and y axis to be the launch site, and hue to be the class value
sns.catplot(y="LaunchSite", x="FlightNumber", hue="Class", data=df, aspect = 5)
plt.xlabel("Flight Number",fontsize=20)
plt.ylabel("Launch Site",fontsize=20)

plt.show()

Now try to explain the patterns you found in the Flight Number vs. Launch Site scatter point plots.

TASK 2: Visualize the relationship between Payload and Launch Site
We also want to observe if there is any relationship between launch sites and their payload mass.

# Plot a scatter point chart with x axis to be Pay Load Mass (kg) and y axis to be the launch site, and hue to be the class value
# Plot a scatter point chart with x axis to be Flight Number and y axis to be the launch site, and hue to be the class value
sns.catplot(x="PayloadMass", y="LaunchSite", hue="Class", data=df, aspect = 5)
plt.xlabel("Launch Site",fontsize=20)
plt.ylabel("Pay load Mass",fontsize=20)
plt.show()

Now if you observe Payload Vs. Launch Site scatter point chart you will find for the VAFB-SLC launchsite there are no rockets launched for heavypayload mass(greater than 10000).

TASK 3: Visualize the relationship between success rate of each orbit type
Next, we want to visually check if there are any relationship between success rate and orbit type.

Let's create a bar chart for the sucess rate of each orbit

# HINT use groupby method on Orbit column and get the mean of Class column
orb = df.groupby(['Orbit']).mean().reset_index()
new = orb[['Orbit','Class']]
new['Class'] = new['Class']*100
sns.barplot(x='Orbit',y='Class',data=new)
/tmp/wsuser/ipykernel_154/2436076646.py:4: SettingWithCopyWarning: 
A value is trying to be set on a copy of a slice from a DataFrame.
Try using .loc[row_indexer,col_indexer] = value instead

See the caveats in the documentation: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html#returning-a-view-versus-a-copy
  new['Class'] = new['Class']*100
<AxesSubplot:xlabel='Orbit', ylabel='Class'>

Analyze the ploted bar chart try to find which orbits have high sucess rate.

TASK 4: Visualize the relationship between FlightNumber and Orbit type
For each orbit, we want to see if there is any relationship between FlightNumber and Orbit type.

# Plot a scatter point chart with x axis to be FlightNumber and y axis to be the Orbit, and hue to be the class value
sns.catplot(y="Orbit", x="FlightNumber", hue="Class", data=df, aspect = 5)
plt.xlabel("Flight Number",fontsize=20)
plt.ylabel("Orbit",fontsize=20)
plt.show()

You should see that in the LEO orbit the Success appears related to the number of flights; on the other hand, there seems to be no relationship between flight number when in GTO orbit.

TASK 5: Visualize the relationship between Payload and Orbit type
Similarly, we can plot the Payload vs. Orbit scatter point charts to reveal the relationship between Payload and Orbit type

# Plot a scatter point chart with x axis to be Payload and y axis to be the Orbit, and hue to be the class value
sns.catplot(y="Orbit", x="PayloadMass", hue="Class", data=df, aspect = 5)
plt.xlabel("PayLoadMass",fontsize=20)
plt.ylabel("Orbit",fontsize=20)
plt.show()

With heavy payloads the successful landing or positive landing rate are more for Polar,LEO and ISS.

However for GTO we cannot distinguish this well as both positive landing rate and negative landing(unsuccessful mission) are both there here.

TASK 6: Visualize the launch success yearly trend
You can plot a line chart with x axis to be Year and y axis to be average success rate, to get the average launch success trend.

The function will help you get the year from the date:

# A function to Extract years from the date 
year=[]
def Extract_year(date):
    for i in df["Date"]:
        year.append(i.split("-")[0])
    return year
    
# Plot a line chart with x axis to be the extracted year and y axis to be the success rate
df['year'] = Extract_year(year)
df['Success Rate'] = df['Class'] * 100
sns.lineplot(data=df,x='year',y='Success Rate')
<AxesSubplot:xlabel='year', ylabel='Success Rate'>

you can observe that the sucess rate since 2013 kept increasing till 2020

Features Engineering
By now, you should obtain some preliminary insights about how each important variable would affect the success rate, we will select the features that will be used in success prediction in the future module.

features = df[['FlightNumber', 'PayloadMass', 'Orbit', 'LaunchSite', 'Flights', 'GridFins', 'Reused', 'Legs', 'LandingPad', 'Block', 'ReusedCount', 'Serial']]
features.head()
FlightNumber	PayloadMass	Orbit	LaunchSite	Flights	GridFins	Reused	Legs	LandingPad	Block	ReusedCount	Serial
0	1	6104.959412	LEO	CCAFS SLC 40	1	False	False	False	NaN	1.0	0	B0003
1	2	525.000000	LEO	CCAFS SLC 40	1	False	False	False	NaN	1.0	0	B0005
2	3	677.000000	ISS	CCAFS SLC 40	1	False	False	False	NaN	1.0	0	B0007
3	4	500.000000	PO	VAFB SLC 4E	1	False	False	False	NaN	1.0	0	B1003
4	5	3170.000000	GTO	CCAFS SLC 40	1	False	False	False	NaN	1.0	0	B1004
TASK 7: Create dummy variables to categorical columns
Use the function get_dummies and features dataframe to apply OneHotEncoder to the column Orbits, LaunchSite, LandingPad, and Serial. Assign the value to the variable features_one_hot, display the results using the method head. Your result dataframe must include all features including the encoded ones.

# HINT: Use get_dummies() function on the categorical columns
dum_orbit = pd.get_dummies(features["Orbit"])
dum_launch = pd.get_dummies(features["LaunchSite"])
dum_landing = pd.get_dummies(features["LandingPad"])
dum_serial = pd.get_dummies(features["Serial"])
remainder = features[["FlightNumber","PayloadMass", "Flights", "GridFins", "Reused", "Legs", "Block","ReusedCount"]]
features_one_hot = pd.concat([dum_launch, dum_landing, dum_serial, dum_orbit], axis=1)
features_one_hot.head()
CCAFS SLC 40	KSC LC 39A	VAFB SLC 4E	5e9e3032383ecb267a34e7c7	5e9e3032383ecb554034e7c9	5e9e3032383ecb6bb234e7ca	5e9e3032383ecb761634e7cb	5e9e3033383ecbb9e534e7cc	B0003	B0005	...	GEO	GTO	HEO	ISS	LEO	MEO	PO	SO	SSO	VLEO

4	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	...	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
5 rows × 72 columns

TASK 8: Cast all numeric columns to float64
Now that our features_one_hot dataframe only contains numbers cast the entire dataframe to variable type float64

# HINT: use astype function

features_one_hot.astype('float64')
CCAFS SLC 40	KSC LC 39A	VAFB SLC 4E	5e9e3032383ecb267a34e7c7	5e9e3032383ecb554034e7c9	5e9e3032383ecb6bb234e7ca	5e9e3032383ecb761634e7cb	5e9e3033383ecbb9e534e7cc	B0003	B0005	...	GEO	GTO	HEO	ISS	LEO	MEO	PO	SO	SSO	VLEO

We can now export it to a CSV for the next section,but to make the answers consistent, in the next lab we will provide data in a pre-selected date range.
